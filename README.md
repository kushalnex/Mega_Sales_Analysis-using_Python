# Mega_Sales_Analysis-using_Python
The sales data stored in a CSV file is used to analyze the data inside it, in Jupyter Notebook. In this project, we've used the four main libraries (i.e., numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and pandas) for the purpose of analyzing and visualization.
- The insights derived from the analysis help us understand our consumers better, their interests, which type of consumers buy the most and their maximum amount they spent.
- Visualization is for better and easy understanding plus these graphs could be carried on the other software and files/reports which saves time and energy.
